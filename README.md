Pygame script to show textfiles as a slideshow

It loads the text files from the current directory that match f\*.txt.

The text files will then subsequently be displayed in a small borderless
window. Every few seconds, the next file will be shown. After a global
timeout, the script quits.

Later I will add the option to configure the options in a configfile or
via commandline.

This script is used to show stuff on the LCD display that I have attached
to my raspberry pi.
